## Exegesis of 1 Samuel 16:1-13

1 Samuel 16:1-13 tells the story of how God chose David to be the next king of Israel. The text begins by describing how the Lord spoke to Samuel, the prophet, and told him to go to the house of Jesse in Bethlehem. When Samuel arrived, he saw Jesse's oldest son, Eliab, and thought he must be the one God had chosen. However, the Lord told Samuel that he should not judge by outward appearances, but rather by the state of a person's heart. So, Samuel continued to look at Jesse's other sons, but none of them were chosen by God. Finally, Jesse brought out his youngest son, David, who was out tending to the sheep. The Lord told Samuel that this was the one he had chosen to be the next king of Israel. This passage is significant because it shows how God can choose anyone, even the least likely candidate, to fulfill his plans. It also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond outward appearances and focusing on a person's inner character. This passage highlights the importance of the heart in God's eyes. It also shows that God's choices are not always based on what humans consider to be important or valuable. In this case, God chooses David, the youngest and seemingly least important son, to be the next king. This shows that God looks at the heart and not just outward appearances. It also serves as a reminder that God's ways are not always the same as ours, and that we should trust in his choices and plans for us.
