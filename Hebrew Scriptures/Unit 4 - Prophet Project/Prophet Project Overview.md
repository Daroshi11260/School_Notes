### Requirements: 

A. Prophet Profile – Typed responses to the “Prophet Profile Questions.”

B. Scholarly Exegesis – Typed responses to the “Exegesis Questions.” 

C. Modern Application – A creatively expressed message of your prophet to the modern world.

  

### Process:

Step 1 – Prophet Profile. Read and respond to the questions about your prophet. Use the textbook, the Bible (introduction to your prophet’s book), ONE biblical resource book, and the “Read Scripture” Video on Youtube.  You may not use other Internet sources.

Step 2 - Exegesis. Read the passage and two commentaries to respond to the questions on the scripture passage that is assigned. Use two biblical commentaries that directly address the particular passage.

Step 3 – Modern Application.  Now that you have spent two days exploring your prophet in depth – background, main themes, style of prophesying – think about the world today.  If your prophet was alive and prophesying today what would his message be? How would he express God’s message to society? You can (1) write out a modern day passage from the perspective of your prophet that addresses a modern day injustice; or (2) create a symbolic image that depicts your prophet and his message; or (3) create a 3 song playlist that captures the spirit and message of your prophet.

#### Step 3

Modern Application.  You can (1) write out a modern day passage from the perspective of your prophet that addresses a modern day injustice; or (2) create a symbolic image that depicts your prophet and his message; or (3) create a 3 song playlist that captures the spirit and message of your prophet.

For a modern day passage: write out your prophet’s message for today’s world in about 150 words. Write in the style of your prophet and in the first person. Think about the following questions before writing:

1.  What issue would your prophet address today?
    
2.  What would he say about this issue?
    
3.  How did your prophet speak? (Visions, prose, verse, dramatic actions, etc…)
    
4.  What imagery was used? What imagery can you use today?
    

  

For a symbolic image:

1.  Depict the prophet and 3-4 symbols relevant to the life and message of the prophet
    
2.  Explain specifically why you chose the symbols that you did (1-2 sentences per symbol)
    

  

For a playlist - Create a 3-song playlist that captures the spirit or message of your prophet.

1.  For each song include title/artist/ link to song/lyrics
    
2.  Explain specifically why the song you chose is important/appropriate for your prophet (1-2 sentences per song)
