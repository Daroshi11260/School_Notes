Dear Supporters of the Monduli District Water Harvesting Project,

Happy New Year! We wanted to provide a follow-up on the progress of our project and thank you again for your generous support.

First off, thank you so much for your continued support with our project, from beginning to end. From a plan that formulated in the beginning of 2021, we can proudly say that so far we have been successful in achieving our goal of providing clean and accessible water to the Maasai community in Monduli.

After careful consideration and consultation with student leaders and community members, we decided to split the funds into three separate projects in order to be more effective and water efficient for the community. These projects focused on improving water accessibility and infrastructure in the region.

We are happy to report that the projects have been successful and have made a significant impact on the daily lives of the Maasai community. The women no longer have to walk long distances to fetch water, and children are able to attend school without the burden of survival tasks. This has opened up opportunities for education and economic growth within the community.

In addition to the completed projects, we have also conducted our own research and brainstormed potential solutions for the next phase of our efforts. We are currently in the process of creating a program that will subsidize the cost of low-cost water harvesting units for families in remote areas, making it easier for them to access clean water.

We are grateful for your support and are committed to continuing our work towards providing clean and accessible water to the Maasai community. If you have any questions about the data collected, feel free to reach out to anyone on our team, and we will be sure to reach out to you.

Sincerely,

The Water Harvesting Team
